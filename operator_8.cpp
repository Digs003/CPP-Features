//Overloaded typecasts must be non-static members, and should be const so they can be used with const objects.
//Overloaded typecasts do not have explicit parameters, as there is no way to pass explicit arguments to them. They do still have a hidden *this parameter, pointing to the implicit object (which is the object to be converted).
//Overloaded typecast do not declare a return type. The name of the conversion (e.g. int) is used as the return type, as it is the only return type allowed. This prevents redundancy in the declaration.
